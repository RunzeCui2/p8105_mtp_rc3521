## Problem 1

The raw data is about three pet dogs’ weights. Some remarkable variables
like names, recording date and standard deviation of the weight are
listed but it is so messy.

For the first data frame, firstly, we import and tidy the dataset,
deleting the missing and blank column and manipulating the `DATE` column
by removing some unnecessary input ‘s’.

Next, we notice that three dog’s weight are recorded in pounds. However,
the standard deviation (`std`) is in ounces. We need to unify the units.

Then, select required column and arrange it by date

``` r
dog_weight_df = 
  read_excel("./data/dogweights_07may2022.xlsx", skip = 1) %>% # import the data and get rid of the first row
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(  
    raisin:gagne,
    names_to = "Dog_name",
    values_to = "Dog_weights"
  ) %>% # change the format
  separate(Dog_weights, into = c("lbs", "oz"), sep = 2) %>% # separate the weight's unit by 'lbs' and 'oz' respectively
  separate(std, into = c("lbs_sd", "oz_sd"), sep = 2) %>% # separate the standard deviation's unit by 'lbs' and 'oz' respectively
  mutate(Weight = as.numeric(lbs) + as.numeric(oz) / 16) %>% # unify the units of weights
  mutate(std = as.numeric(lbs_sd) + as.numeric(oz_sd) / 16) %>% # unify the units of standard deviation
  mutate(date = as.Date(as.numeric(date), origin = "1899-12-30")) %>%  # change the date format and show it as readable one.
  drop_na(Weight) %>% # remove missing data
  select(date, Dog_name, Weight, std) %>% # choose the required columns
  arrange(date) # rearrange our data by date
```

For the second data frame, after importing the raw data, we clean it by
removing the missing data and combining the three columns of weight and
its corresponding units (in pounds). And we select the column of `date`
and `notes` at the end.

``` r
dog_notes_df =
  read_excel("./data/dogweights_07may2022.xlsx", skip = 1) %>% # import the data and get rid of the first row
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(notes = x6) %>% # rename the notes.
  mutate(date = as.Date(as.numeric(date), origin = "1899-12-30")) %>%  # change the date format and show it as readable one.
  drop_na(c(date, notes)) %>% # remove missing data
  select(date, notes) %>% # choose the required columns
  arrange(date) # rearrange our data by date
```

Export two data frames in the same directory

``` r
write.csv(dog_weight_df, "./data/dog_weight_df.csv")
write.csv(dog_notes_df, "./data/dog_notes_df.csv")
```

## Problem 2

There are 356 unique date in weight resulting date based on the chunk
below. There are 4 different variables (`date`, `Dog_name`, `Weight`,
and `std`) and totally 810 observations.

The unique date is calculated by the chunk:

``` r
dog_weight_df %>% 
  distinct(date) %>% # Find the distinct date
  drop_na(date) %>% 
  nrow() # count the distinct date
```

    ## [1] 356

Then, in this question, we need to calculate the mean and standard
deviation of weights for each dog, inserting it into a summary table.

``` r
dog_weight_df %>% # import the resulting data frame
  select(Dog_name, Weight) %>% # select required columns
  group_by(Dog_name) %>% # group the data and do summary statistics
  summarize(
    Number_of_Observations = n(),
    Average_Weight = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    Standard_deviation = sd(Weight, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3, col.names = c("Dog name", "Number of Observations", "Average Weight (lbs)", "Standard Deviation (lbs)")) # show it as a table and rename the columns' name.
```

| Dog name | Number of Observations | Average Weight (lbs) | Standard Deviation (lbs) |
|:---------|-----------------------:|---------------------:|-------------------------:|
| gagne    |                    120 |               10.295 |                    0.706 |
| raisin   |                    356 |               17.786 |                    0.934 |
| simone   |                    334 |                9.791 |                    0.916 |

## Problem 3

Now we do some visualizations. Create two-panel plot for distribution of
weight on the left and each dog’s weight over time on the right.

We need to first drop ‘NA’ data in `dog_weight_df`, then, reorder the
factor and draw a density ridges plot through ggplot. We also can adjust
the scale value of our plot to make it more visualized and do not forget
to label the plot at the end.

``` r
plot_1 =
  dog_weight_df %>% 
  drop_na(date) %>% 
  mutate(
    Dog_name = factor(Dog_name),
    Dog_name = fct_reorder(Dog_name, Weight)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Weight, y = Dog_name)) +
  geom_density_ridges(scale = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Weights",
    x = "Weight (lbs)",
    y = "Dog Name"
  )
```

Now we draw the plot of dog’s weight over time. We need to use the
`Dog_name`, `Weight`, and `date` columns to draw this plot. The line are
colored by `Dog_name`. Besides, I adjust the date format by
`scale_x_date` and change its angle by
`axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)`. This may let the x-axis more
clear to read. Since the date may mixed if we show it as horizontal
format.

``` r
plot_2 =
  dog_weight_df %>%
  drop_na(date) %>%
  mutate(
  Dog_name = factor(Dog_name),
  Dog_name = fct_reorder(Dog_name, Weight)
  ) %>%
  group_by(Dog_name) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = Weight, color = Dog_name)) +
  geom_line(scale = 1) +
  labs(
  title = "Dog's Weights Over Time",
  x = "Date",
  y = "Weights"
  ) +
  scale_x_date(
  date_breaks = "5 months",
  date_labels = "%m-%d-%y"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"
    ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

``` r
dog_weight_two_panel = plot_1 + plot_2
dog_weight_two_panel
```

Export the plot

``` r
ggsave("./results/dog_weight_two_panel.pdf", dog_weight_two_panel, width = 10, height = 6)
```

#### Comments

Based on the two panel plots, for the left one, the density plot
indicate that Raisin is much more heavier than Gagne and Simone. And the
weights of Gagne and Simone is quite similar.

Based on the right plot, there is a huge decrease of weight of Raisin
and then back to normal. We highly suspected this as an error during the
observations. Simone’s weight also show a decreasing trend and keep
declining until near the end of observation. However, Gagne’s weight
drop and stopped, corresponding with the notes that he died in September
2019.
